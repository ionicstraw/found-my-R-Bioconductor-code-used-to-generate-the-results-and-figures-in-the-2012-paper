# found-my-R-Bioconductor-code-used-to-generate-the-results-and-figures-in-the-2012-paper

for near future legal proceedings, gonna have a lot of fun with this. choosing to not put it on github for now, i dunno maybe, but u get the idea

i havent logged into my dropbox for prolly a decade or something

the story with that poster is that i forgot the actual physical poster in debashish's rent a car trunk in charleston so we were not able to put it up in the hallway in the building at rutgers even tho jef(post doc) gave me his own poster tube it put it in for the flight home, i dunno, i was so much younger and i felt so bad, doesnt matter i guess u can look at it now lol
